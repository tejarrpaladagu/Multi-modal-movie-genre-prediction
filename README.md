# Multi-modal-movie-genre-prediction

A multi-modal deep learning model trained to predict a movie's genre given the movie poster and overview as an input.

Modality is a particular way of doing or experiencing something. We live our daily lives in a multimodal environment. We see things, hear sounds, smell odours and feel textures. Analogous to this, multimodal deep learning involves multiple modalities used together to predict some output. In this project, I concatenated the features extracted from images and text sequences using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, respectively. These features were used to try and predict movie genres.
